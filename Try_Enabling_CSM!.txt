If you struggle running from USB drive, even having 64-bit UEFI,
try enabling Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your boot settings

It may be called Enable Legacy/CSM Boot Support or something like that

This also helps if USB drive formatted incorrectly (still may work on some computers with some UEFI firmware)

It is recommended to enable "USB Port 64/60 Emulation" and "USB Legacy Support" if available
