## Features

 - UEFI 64-bit boot
 - 64-bit x86 oriented
 - Colorful graphics with transparency and double buffering
 - Quake-style terminal (hit `~` to show/hide)
 - Desktop GUI
 - PS/2 mouse
 - PS/2 keyboard
 - COM-port debug output
 - Initial RAM disk for LiveCD/LiveUSB and installer
 - Tested on those VMs:
   - VirtualBox 6.0+ `(use exactly "Mac OS X (64-bit)" preset)`
   - Hyper-V `(use Generation 2, disable Secure Boot, no PS/2 support, read tools\pipe.js for more info)`
   - WMware Workstation `(Other 64-bit, Virtualize Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI, Firmware type - UEFI)`
 - Hybrid performance-oriented kernel
 - Very low on resources, just 1 GB RAM minimum required
 - Isolation and containerization of everything
 - ACPI 2.0, CPUID, SEH-style memory probing in syscalls
 - Preemptive multitasking/multithreading (both kernel and userspace)
 - Exclusively only multi-core CPUs

## GreenteaOS (Tofita) system requirements

- 1 GB RAM
- Motherboard with UEFI, SATA (AHCI) or NVMe, PCIe and USB 2.0+
- Multicore modern 64-bit CPU (most AMD and Intel CPUs from 2009 and newer)

- [`pipe.js`](tools/pipe.js) - listen to VirtualBox\Hyper-V COM port in pipe mode
- [`vbox.js`](tools/vbox.js) - starts VirtualBox Tofita VM and exits
- [`webui.bat`](tools/webui/webui.bat) - web-based UI for COM port
- [`gos-devlist.bat`](tools/gos-devlist.bat) - show useful device names and PCI IDs to gather user hardware stats

## Build

Get automatic build or make yours with Teapot (if you want to edit the code)

#### Nightly builds

If you don't want to build Tofita, you may [download latest automatic GitHub build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/PeyTy/tofita/build/artifacts)

#### Teapot

Download or clone [Teapot repo](https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Teapot#download-latest-zip) and place alongside of Tofita repo:

```
.\Teapot
.\Tofita
```

You should have extracted `Teapot-master` and have folders like this `.\Teapot\LLVM-*.*.*`.

Teapot will take less space if cloned with limited depth of commit history:

```sh
git clone --recursive --depth 1 https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Tofita.git
git clone --recursive --depth 1 https://github.com/GreenteaOS/Teapot.git
```

#### Configure

Create `R:` ram disk about 1 GB (you may download a free [AMD Radeonâ„¢ RAMDisk](http://radeonramdisk.com/files/Radeon_RAMDisk_4_4_0_RC36.msi)) for faster builds and configure `config.json > tempFolder`.
Otherwise `C:` is used to store builds by default.

#### Install Hexa

You also need to install [Hexa compiler](https://github.com/hexalang/hexa#unstable).

Currently you will build Hexa manually too. Download [this](https://github.com/hexalang/hexa/archive/kawaii.zip) and extract contents of `hexa-kawaii` into `C:\Hexa`, so you have `C:\Hexa\hexa.cmd`.

Install [node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

```sh
cd C:\hexa
node bootstrap.js hexa.json
node hexa-node.js hexa.json
node hexa-node.js hexa.json
```

Add `C:\Hexa` into your PATH.

#### Compile and generate disk image

```sh
cmd /c build
```

Or just open `build.bat` file with Explorer.
