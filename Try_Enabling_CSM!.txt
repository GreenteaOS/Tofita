If you struggle running from USB drive, even having 64-bit UEFI, try enabling Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your boot settings

It may also be called Enable Legacy/CSM Boot Support or something like that

This also helps if USB drive formatted incorrectly (still may work on some computers with some UEFI firmware)
