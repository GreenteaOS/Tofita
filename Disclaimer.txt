Disclaimer & Known Issues

As with any pre-release software, there are are some known issues in this beta release.
Check the public project board for known regressions, as well as the progress towards the stable release.

And as always:

- We do not recommend using beta builds on your primary device, as irrecoverable crashes and data loss are possible.

- It will not be possible to upgrade to the stable release from beta builds.

- Some user-facing features are unfinished and in rapid development; beta releases are intended for developers.
